- A static buffer class, that is a simple wrapper around existing memory regions,
  where those regions are assured to last longer than the static buffer
- Re-name re-naming back to: object + action, is currently action + object e.g
  is_end_byte_iterator
- Implement pb_line_reader_terminate_line_check_cr
- Consider a data_revision policy for iterators
- Consider changing the way strategy flags are set, maybe modifier functions or
  parameterisable initialisers
- Consider consolidatieng some of the write interfaces
- Consider a pb_trivial_buffer_page_create_mem function (memory region to be
  taken over by the buffer)
- Add a thread exclusivity debugging API
