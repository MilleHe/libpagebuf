- object style structure for allocator, just like others
- Can object be declared before operations
- Implement write operations as calls to insert operations
- insert functions don't respect strategy.  Make them!
- page_create doesn't need iterator or is_rewind marker
- Remove functional interfaces that shouldn't be called externally
- Remove pb_get_trivial_data_reader_operations
- Add 'end' byte (\0)
- Add overwrite_buffer
- Make pb_data::data_vec const
- Convert some public uint8_t* interfaces to void* so end users are not
  required to do casting.
- fragment_as_target(false) should not even fragment to page_size, original
  fragment sizes should remain unchanged.
- pagebuf_mmap.hpp
- Consider making pb::line_reader and pb::data_reader non copy/= able
- Document as thread unsafe.  Reference counting to be non atomic
- Add a thread exclusivity debugging API
