- Inline Documentation
- Implement pb_line_reader_terminate_line_check_cr
- Copy On Write for buffer pages, with last-reference checking operation part of data_operations
- Unity between strategy (particularly rejects_insert(false), and allocators or let allocators dictate insertion
- Consider dropping type from free functions
- Consider removing pb_page_set_data
- Consider making iterator_get operations part of pb_buffer so they may be specialised
- Consider a data_revision policy for iterators
- Consider changing the way strategy flags are set, maybe modifier functions or parameterisable initialisers
- Consider iterators holding reference counts to pages
- Consider iterators as virtual classes, created by the get_iterator operations rather than initialised by it
- Consider joining extend and reserve operations
- Consider consolidating some of the write interfaces
- Consider a pb_trivial_buffer_page_create_mem function (memory region to be taken over by the buffer)
- Re-ordering of pb_buffer, pb_buffer_iterator and pb_buffer_strategy
- Only describe generic behaviour or describe buffer operations objectively in
  the base class documentation.  Specific behaviours descibed in the subclass.
  (eg, concept of data revision)
- Add a thread exclusivity debugging API
