- A static buffer class, that is a simple wrapper around existing memory regions,
  where those regions are assured to last longer than the static buffer
- Re-name re-naming back to: object + action, is currently action + object e.g
  is_end_byte_iterator
- Implement pb_line_reader_terminate_line_check_cr
- Copy On Write for buffer pages, with last-reference checking operation part of
  data_operations
- Add calloc and realloc allocator operations
- Consider dropping type from free functions
- Consider a data_revision policy for iterators
- Consider changing the way strategy flags are set, maybe modifier functions or
  parameterisable initialisers
- Consider iterators as virtual classes, created by the get_iterator operations
  rather than initialised by it
- Consider joining extend and reserve operations
- Consider consolidating some of the write interfaces
- Consider a pb_trivial_buffer_page_create_mem function (memory region to be
  taken over by the buffer)
- Add a thread exclusivity debugging API
